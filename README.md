# Cryptocurrency Clustering Project: Unveiling Market Trends


## Getting Started

1. **Clone This Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: Access the interactive Jupyter Notebook to explore the project.
3. **Run the Code Cells**: Execute the code cells to analyze cryptocurrency data and uncover market trends.

## ðŸ“Š Project
### Data Preparation

Begin by standardizing and scaling the dataset using the StandardScaler module. This ensures uniformity in the data and prepares it for analysis.

### Determining the Optimal Cluster Count (k)

Utilize the elbow method to identify the optimal number of clusters (k). By analyzing inertia values across various k values, pinpoint the most suitable k for clustering.

### Clustering Cryptocurrencies with K-means

Implement K-means clustering using the determined optimal k value. Group cryptocurrencies into clusters based on their features and uncover insights into market segmentation.

### Extracting Insights with PCA

Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the dataset to uncover deeper insights. Through dimensionality reduction, gain a clearer understanding of cryptocurrency market dynamics.
